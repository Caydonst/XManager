# Introduction
This app is a password manager app. With the growth of technology over the decades, account hacking is becoming more prevalent. People need to start creating more abstract and unique passwords but these passwords aren’t exactly easy to rememeber. That’s where our password manager app helps out. Once downloaded, the user will be prompted to create an account or login. Once their account is created they will create a master key. This master key will allow them to access their passwords once they’re logged into their account. They will have options to create, edit, copy and delete passwords. Every time you log into your account you will be prompted to enter your master key, then you will have access to you passwords.
