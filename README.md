# Abstract
This app works as a password manager that will take a master password and uses encryption to protect and store your passwords for other apps or websites that you can use. This was an exploration into how encryption would look and work as well as a test of our coding skills.


# Introduction
This app is a password manager app. With the growth of technology over the decades, account hacking is becoming more prevalent. People need to start creating more abstract and unique passwords but these passwords aren’t exactly easy to rememeber. That’s where our password manager app helps out. Once downloaded, the user will be prompted to create an account or login. Once their account is created they will create a master password. This master password will allow them to login and access their passwords. They will have options to create, edit, copy and delete passwords. Every time you log into your account you will be prompted to enter your master password, then you will have access to your passwords.
